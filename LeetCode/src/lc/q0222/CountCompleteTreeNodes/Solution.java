/* Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

 * Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
 * In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
